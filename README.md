Description:
This project is my final group assignment for the Computer Programming II course, supervised by Professor Yalçın ALBAYRAK. It is a classic Pong game fully implemented in C with my own algorithm. The game features two-player controls, realistic ball physics, and a scoring system. Utilizing Windows API, it includes functions for drawing the game field, updating scores, and handling ball-paddle collisions. This project significantly enhanced my understanding of C programming and system-level APIs.

Technologies Used: C, Windows API, Console Graphics
Acknowledgment: Special thanks to Professor Yalçın ALBAYRAK for all his support.
